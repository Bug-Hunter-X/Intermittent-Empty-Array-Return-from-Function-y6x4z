# Intermittent Empty Array Return from PHP Function

This repository demonstrates a perplexing bug where a PHP function inconsistently returns an empty array even when provided with a non-empty input array. The root cause is subtle and difficult to trace.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` offers a solution.

**Problem:** The `processData` function, intended to manipulate and return an array, occasionally returns an empty array despite receiving a populated input array. This erratic behavior makes debugging challenging. 

**Solution:** The solution involves careful examination of all potential points of array modification within the function, particularly focusing on potential edge cases or unintended side effects. The `bugSolution.php` file demonstrates a solution that addresses this unpredictability and ensures consistent behavior.
